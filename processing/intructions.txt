Files to Share:

Core Processing Files:

processing/document_processor.py - The main processor logic
core/ocr_processor.py - OCR processing implementation
core/text_extractor.py - Data extraction logic
database/models.py - Database schema to understand what's stored


Web Interface Files:

web/templates/document_detail.html - Current document detail view
web/routes/web_routes.py - Route handling for document details
web/static/css/style.css - Current styling


Sample Data:

If possible, a screenshot of what currently happens when you click the "eye" icon
Any example of OCR text output you might have in logs



Session Goals:

Create Enhanced Document Detail Mockup showing:

Original document preview
Raw OCR text output with confidence scores
Extraction attempts section (what patterns were tried)
Field-by-field results (why vendor=Unknown, amount=N/A)
Processing timeline/steps
Manual correction interface for failed extractions


Plan Implementation Strategy:

What data needs to be stored in database
How to modify the processor to capture debug info
UI/UX flow for the enhanced detail view


Dashboard Improvements:

Better status indicators showing extraction quality
Quick preview of extraction confidence
Bulk correction capabilities



Instructions for Next Session:
"I want to enhance the document detail view to show OCR results, extraction debugging info, and allow manual corrections. Here are my current files: [attach files]. Let's start with a mockup of the improved document detail page showing full processing transparency."
This will give us everything needed to design both the UI and underlying data structure!
