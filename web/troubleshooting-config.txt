Looking at your `web_routes.py` code, I can see the issue. The problem is in the configuration route around line 146 where it's trying to use `config.set()`, but your `config` object doesn't have a `set` method.

In your code, you're using:
```python
config.set('paperless', 'api_url', request.form.get('paperless_api_url'))
```

But based on how you're reading config values elsewhere in the code with:
```python
config.get('paperless', 'api_url', fallback='')
```

It looks like you're using Python's `configparser.ConfigParser` object, which does have a `set()` method. However, the error suggests that your `config` object might be a different type or a custom wrapper class.

The issue is likely that:
1. Your `config` object in Docker is a different type than in Replit, OR
2. The `config` object being passed to the blueprint doesn't have the `set` method

Can you show me:
1. How the `config` object is created and passed to `create_web_blueprint()`?
2. What type of config system you're using (custom class, configparser, etc.)?

This will help identify why `config.set()` works in Replit but fails in Docker with the `AttributeError`.
