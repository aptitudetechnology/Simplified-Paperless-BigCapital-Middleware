**Problem Summary:**
I have a Flask application with a configuration flag `USE_MODULAR_ROUTES = True/False` in `app.py` that should allow seamless switching between legacy and modular routing approaches. Currently, when set to `True`, I get this error:

```
BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'web.configuration'. Did you mean 'config.configuration' instead?
```

The issue is that my modular approach creates blueprints with different names than my legacy approach, breaking template URL references.

**Requirements:**
1. I want to be able to toggle `USE_MODULAR_ROUTES` between `True` and `False` and have everything work seamlessly
2. I prefer to make changes ONLY to `app.py` if possible, or minimal changes to other files
3. The solution should maintain template compatibility without requiring template updates
4. My templates currently reference endpoints like `web.configuration`, `web.something`, etc.

**Current Structure:**
- Legacy approach: Uses blueprints named `api` and `web`
- Modular approach: Creates separate `api`, `web`, and `config` blueprints
- Templates expect endpoints like `web.configuration` to exist

**Question:**
How can I modify my `app.py` file to ensure that when `USE_MODULAR_ROUTES = True`, the blueprint names and endpoint names remain consistent with the legacy approach? I'm open to solutions like:
- Passing blueprint names as parameters to factory functions
- Merging blueprints during registration
- Any other approach that keeps changes minimal and maintains seamless switching

Please provide the specific code changes needed in `app.py` and any minimal changes required in other files.

This should give you a focused response on exactly what you need to fix the blueprint naming issue while maintaining your seamless switching capability.

Absolutely! You're right - changing templates can be risky and create maintenance issues. Here's a better approach:
Solution: Make the new modular routes match the legacy route endpoint names exactly
Instead of changing templates, we should ensure that the new modular route structure creates the exact same endpoint names that the templates expect. This way:

✅ Templates remain unchanged
✅ No risk of breaking other template references
✅ Clean migration path
✅ Both routing systems will have identical endpoint names

What I need to do this:

Legacy routes file (legacy_routes.py) - to see all the existing endpoint names
Current modular route files (in web/routes/) - to see what's missing or named differently

The fix will involve:

Ensuring every route in the legacy system has an equivalent route with the same endpoint name in the modular system
Adding any missing routes (like the web.configuration route that's causing the current error)
Making sure the blueprint names and route names match exactly

This approach is much cleaner and safer. Can you share the legacy_routes.py file and the current modular route files?

Perfect! Now I can see all the endpoint names from the legacy routes. Let me also see the current modular route files to understand what's missing or incorrectly named.
From the legacy routes, I can see these web endpoints that need to exist in the modular structure:

web.index (/)
web.upload_page (/upload)
web.documents_list (/documents)
web.document_detail (/document/int:doc_id)
web.configuration (/configuration) - This is the missing one causing the error!

And these API endpoints:

api.upload_file (/api/upload)
api.get_documents (/api/documents)
api.get_document (/api/document/int:doc_id)
api.reprocess_document (/api/document/int:doc_id/reprocess)
api.get_stats (/api/stats)
api.check_duplicate (/api/check-duplicate)
api.refresh_stats (/api/stats/refresh)

Can you now share the current modular route files (the ones in web/routes/) so I can see:

What routes are currently defined
What's missing (especially the web.configuration route)
What might be named differently

This will let me provide the exact fixes needed to make the modular structure match the legacy structure perfectly.
