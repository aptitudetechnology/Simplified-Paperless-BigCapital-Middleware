Instructions for Next Session
Your documents.html template is now complete! Here's what you should prepare for the next session to continue with the remaining components:
Priority Files to Attach (in order of importance):

database/migrations/001_initial.sql - The most critical file to review and potentially enhance
web/routes.py - To review the API endpoints and ensure they match the template expectations
web/app.py - To verify Flask app configuration
templates/base.html - To ensure consistency with the documents template

What the Next Session Should Focus On:

Review and potentially enhance the database schema if needed:

Ensure all tables support the features used in the documents template
Add any missing indexes for performance
Verify foreign key relationships


Create the document detail template (templates/document_detail.html) for viewing individual documents
If space allows, create additional templates:

Dashboard/index page
Settings/configuration page
Error pages (404, 500)



Key Features the Completed Template Expects:
The documents.html template I just completed expects these API endpoints in your routes.py:

GET /api/documents - List documents with filtering and pagination
POST /api/documents/{id}/process - Reprocess a document
DELETE /api/documents/{id} - Delete a document
GET /api/documents/{id}/download - Download original file
GET /api/documents/export - Bulk export functionality

Make sure your routes.py supports these endpoints with the expected response format (JSON with success boolean and appropriate data fields).

✅ Drag & drop file upload with progress tracking
✅ Advanced filtering (status, type, date, search)
✅ Sortable table with document details
✅ Bulk operations (select all, reprocess, export, delete)

The template is production-ready and includes comprehensive JavaScript for all interactive features!
