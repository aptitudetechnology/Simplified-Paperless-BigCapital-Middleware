Before You Use This

    Ensure pytest is available in your Docker image or installed in the test step: The provided Dockerfile in your repository should ideally include pytest in its requirements.txt or you'd want to explicitly install it during the test step, as shown in the example.
    Adjust pytest command: The example pytest command will run all tests. If you want to run specific test categories as outlined in your README.md (e.g., pytest tests/test_ocr.py), you'd modify that line accordingly.
    No Docker Hub Login (yet): This simplified pipeline does not include logging into Docker Hub or pushing images. If you decide to add deployment to Docker Hub later, you'd reintroduce the docker/login-action and a docker push step, likely only on pushes to main.
    No docker-compose: This simpler version avoids docker-compose for the CI build and test, as the primary application can be tested directly with the Dockerfile for unit and integration tests. If your tests strictly require multiple services (like a separate database container that isn't easily mocked or run within the same container), you might need to reintroduce docker-compose for the testing phase. However, for a "much simpler version," direct Docker commands are often preferred for CI if possible. Your database/connection.py suggests SQLite, which is file-based and doesn't necessarily need a separate database container for testing.

This ci.yml provides a solid starting point for your simplified CI/CD, focusing on the essential build and test steps for your Flask application.

Do you have any specific parts of the old CI/CD setup that you'd like to re-incorporate or simplify further?
